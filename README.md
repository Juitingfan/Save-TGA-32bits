# Save-TGA-32bits
Save TGA 32bits with straight alpha in photoshop CS6+

How it works:
1) All layers that are expected to be shown should be placed in one single layerset(target layerset). 
2) The TGA file will be named after the name of the target layerset.
3) Place the target layerset on the top. (If not, an alert will appear and stop the process.)
4) Turn off the visibility of layers that are not expected to be shown. Collapse all expanded layersets. 
5) Select the target layerset(only one selection is allowed) and execute SaveTGA32bits.jsx
6) TGA file will be saved in the same directory of the psd file.
